### **Goal**

Get comfortable with using a Linux shell, understand basic command-line operations, and learn how to interact with the file system using commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `file`, and `cat`.

----------

### **Key Topics Covered**

**1. What is Linux?**

-   Learned that Linux is an open-source operating system widely used for development and security.
    
-   Understood that Linux systems are typically controlled through the command-line interface (CLI).
    
-   Learned that Linux runs on many devices including personal computers, servers, and IoT devices.
    

**2. Accessing a Linux Machine**

-   Connected to a virtual Linux machine using a web-based terminal.
    
-   Used the `whoami` command to verify current user identity.
    
-   Learned how to start and interact with TryHackMe machines.
    

**3. The Linux Shell**

-   Understood the shell as a command interpreter allowing interaction with the system.
    
-   Practiced using Bash, the most common shell.
    
-   Used the arrow keys to cycle through command history.

    

**4. The File System**

-   Navigated directories with `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd`.
    
-   Learned the Linux file system hierarchy and common directories like `/home` and `/etc`.
    
-   Understood absolute vs relative paths.
    

**5. Viewing and Interacting with Files**

-   Used `file` to determine file types.
    
-   Used `cat` to display file contents.
    
-   Learned to use redirection operators:
    
    -   `>` to overwrite a file.
        
    -   `>>` to append to a file.
        
-   Learned the difference between:
    
    -   `&` to run a command in the background.
        
    -   `&&` to run a second command only if the first succeeds.

**6. Searching for Files and Content**

-   Used `find` to locate files and directories based on name or type.
    
-   Used `grep` to search within files for specific text patterns.
        

----------

### **What I Learned**

-   Linux is a powerful open-source OS primarily managed via the terminal.
    
-   The shell interprets commands and enables full system control.
    
-   Navigating the Linux directory structure is essential.
    
-   Basic redirection and command chaining (`>`, `>>`, `&`, `&&`) are key tools for managing processes and files.
