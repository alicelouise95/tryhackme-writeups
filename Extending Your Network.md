### **Goal**

Learn how networks are extended and protected using technologies like port forwarding, firewalls, VPNs, routers, switches, and VLANs. Understand how these components interact to maintain secure and efficient communication across networks.

----------

### **Key Topics Covered**

**1. Port Forwarding**

-   Learned how **port forwarding** allows external devices to access specific internal services within a private network.
    
-   Port forwarding connects incoming traffic to a specified port on a device inside the LAN.
    
-   Even with port forwarding, **firewalls** may restrict access depending on their rules.
    

**2. Firewalls**

-   A **firewall** is a device or software used to control incoming and outgoing traffic on a network.
    
-   It evaluates:
    
    -   **Source/destination IP**
        
    -   **Ports**
        
    -   **Protocols**
        
-   Two types of firewalls:
    
    -   **Stateful**: Tracks the full state of connections. Smarter but resource-heavy.
        
    -   **Stateless**: Uses static rules to evaluate individual packets. Less intelligent but faster and useful in high-traffic scenarios like DDoS protection.
        

**3. VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**

-   VPNs allow **secure communication** between geographically separated networks.
    
-   Benefits: **Privacy**, **anonymity**, and **secure access** to internal network resources.
    
-   Common VPN technologies:
    
    -   **PPP**: A Layer 2 protocol for direct connections.
        
    -   **PPTP**: Uses PPP and allows encrypted traffic to travel outside of the LAN. Easy to set up but weak encryption.
        
    -   **IPSec**: More secure, harder to set up, and widely supported.
        

**4. LAN Devices: Routers and Switches**

-   A **router** connects multiple networks and chooses the best path for data transmission using routing protocols.
    
    -   Path decisions depend on factors like speed, distance, and medium (e.g., copper vs. fiber).
        
-   A **switch** connects multiple devices within the same network using Ethernet.
    
    -   Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) and enables communication between devices.
        

**5. VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)**

-   VLANs allow devices in a single physical LAN to be **logically segmented**.
    
-   This segmentation:
    
    -   Enhances **security** and **traffic management**
        
    -   Allows internal network separation while still sharing services like Internet access
        

----------

### **What I Learned**

-   Port forwarding enables services to be accessed externally but must be managed carefully.
    
-   Firewalls play a critical role in managing and filtering traffic based on dynamic or static rules.
    
-   VPNs securely connect remote networks and differ in encryption strength and complexity.
    
-   Routers and switches serve different purposes but are both essential to LAN functionality.
    
-   VLANs are powerful tools for organizing and securing internal networks.
