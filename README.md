## Cyber Security Learning Log

I'm using this repository to track my progress through cyber security, specifically using TryHackMe. For each room or topic, I write short, structured summaries of what I learned.

**Why I'm doing this:**

-   To understand core concepts clearly
    
-   To build a strong foundation before moving into offensive security
    
-   To keep a consistent, organized record of what Iâ€™ve studied
