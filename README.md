# TryHackMe Writeups

This repository documents my progress through TryHackMe's cybersecurity learning paths. Each file contains a summary of what I’ve learned in a given room, written in my own words.

## Purpose

- To track my learning and progress over time  
- To keep a written record of each completed room  
- To eventually serve as part of a broader portfolio  

---

## Roadmap

I’m following TryHackMe’s official learning path:

- Pre-Security  
- Cyber Security 101  
- Junior Penetration Tester  
- Practical Pentesting (PT1 Certificate)  
- Web Fundamentals  
- Web Application Pentesting  
- Red Teaming

## Notes

- All rooms are from TryHackMe  
- New writeups are added as I complete each room  
- This is an in-progress, long-term project
