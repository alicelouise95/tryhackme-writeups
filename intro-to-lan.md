### **Goal**

Understand what a Local Area Network (LAN) is, how devices communicate in a LAN, and how IP addresses and subnetting work in local networks.

----------

### **Key Topics Covered**

**1. LAN Basics and Topologies**

-   Learned what a LAN is and how it's used in private networks.
    
-   Compared different network topologies: bus, ring, star.
    
-   Analyzed pros and cons of each: cost, effectiveness, and points of failure.
    
-   Identified star topology as the most commonly used and cost-effective today.
    

**2. Subnetting**

-   Learned why subnetting is necessary: separates devices into logical groups.
    
-   Example: A cafe might use two subnets â€” one for staff devices, one for guests.
    
-   Understood subnet masks and how IP ranges are split into:
    
    -   **Network address** (identifies the subnet)
        
    -   **Host addresses** (assigned to devices)
        
    -   **Default gateway** (used to route traffic outside the subnet)
        

**3. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**

-   Understood how ARP links IP addresses to MAC addresses.
    
-   Learned about ARP requests (broadcasts) and ARP replies (responses with MAC).
    

**4. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**

-   Learned how devices receive IP addresses automatically.
    
-   Process:
    
    -   Device sends a **DHCP Discover**
        
    -   Server responds with a **DHCP Offer**
        
    -   Device sends a **DHCP Request**
        
    -   Server replies with a **DHCP Acknowledgement (ACK)**

### **What I Learned**

-   LANs are foundational to all private networking.
    
-   Topology design affects cost, reliability, and maintenance.
    
-   Subnetting improves network security and organization.
    
-   ARP and DHCP are essential for device identification and automatic IP assignment.
